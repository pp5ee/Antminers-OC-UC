### 	Overclocking

​	**This firmware can increase about 10%-40% of the hashrates.**

​	***It's highly recommoned to use immersion cooling system for your machines.**

​	***For air cooling machines,no more than 15%,its an issue about hardware security.**

###      Underclocking 

​		Decrease Watt/T ,example :

Decrease  17 plus   watt/T from 39.7w/T to 32w/t  and T17 from 48.8W/T to 43w/t;

Its a good choice to decrease your power in a bear market or increase you power in a  bull  market.
